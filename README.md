# How Do Media Headlines Actually Deceive Us?

## Misinformation, Disinformation, and Fake News are all words that are thrown around in our current society. Many people claim that it is obvious whether a news article is misleading or not. Even more people will claim that the article is misleading due to its content. I set out to use data to answer some of these questions.

# 1. Data

## The most important part of answering these questions is gathering enough data to draw a clear picture of the present trends. For this particular project I gathered over 2M articles written by over 30 publishers. From these 30, I chose 6 publishers to look at: 3 publishers assoociated with misleading content (Buzzfeed, Vox, and Vice) and 3 publishers associated with political leaning (CNN, Fox, The Hill). After some additional data cleaning I ended up with a dataset that contained over 320k separate articles. The breakdown of the number of articles per publisher is shown below.
