Hi, my name is Greg! I have a Bachelors degree in Mathematics from The Ohio State University, and a Masters degree in Data Analytics and Policy from Johns Hopkins University. I spent over a year living in Europe, including 9 months living in Vienna, Austria for a Fulbright Teaching scholarship. Ever since learning programming I have been instensly fascinated with the idea of applying numerical and statistical techniques to explain social phenomena. I created this blog to showcase some of my research interests as well as random projects I enjoyed.
