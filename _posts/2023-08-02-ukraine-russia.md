## Introduction

Throughout history Russia and Ukraine have had a contentious relationship.. In the past decade, Russia has taken a more aggressive approach starting with annexing a region of Ukraine that connects to the Black Sea called Crimea on March 18, 2014 ([1](https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-24-22-intl/index.html)). This action led to a series of altercations culminating in a Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24th, 2022 ([2](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/world/europe/ukraine.html)). Outside of Eastern Europe, the rest of the world has also been reacting to the events in the region. Media portrayals have credited the growing polarization in the West as resulting in seemingly differing responses to these actions in the East. It is important, however, to conduct a study that will allow us to see the reality of the situation and understand if, in regards to the events of the East, sentiment/emotions have actually differed amongst the very polarized political ideologies. Using the Russian invasion on February 24th, 2022, as a landmark, a thorough sentiment analysis was conducted to investigate this question. The social media platform used for this particular study was Reddit. Reddit was chosen because of its pseudo-anonymity; pseudo-anonymity in this case means that often Reddit accounts do not contain personally identifiable information to individuals, the pseudo part is for the fact that some users wish to contain personally identifiable information. The pseudo-anonymity present in Reddit typically leads to people being more honest in the thoughts and opinions that they share online, since they are not worried about public backlash for a potentially controversial opinion. Reddit was the perfect platform to use in studying sentiment analysis in regard to the Russia Ukraine conflict amongst the differing conservative and liberal ideologies.
